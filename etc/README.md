This project is now working to create a 2-D game environment using pygame.
Here is a list of dependencies:

pygame 1.9.2 or higher
python 2.7.14 or higher

These will be alleviated once this can be packaged as a set of executables.

Bulding the Textbox class is partly thanks to ideas Sean McKiernan put in his
textbox class. See Mekire on GitHub.
