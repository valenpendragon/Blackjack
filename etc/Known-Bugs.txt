Known Bugs:

1. There is a problem that locks up pygame in a continuous loop if the window
focus shifts to another window. This problem only appears when pygame is
waiting for a KEYDOWN event. Textbox objects do not seem to suffer from this
problem. --- Some changes to the event loops seem to have mitigated these problems.

2. A bug appeared in which the function hitOrStand attempts to get a name from an unoccupied seat, causing a fatal crash. --- Repeated attempts to recreate the conditions that produced this crash failed to replicate the disaster.
