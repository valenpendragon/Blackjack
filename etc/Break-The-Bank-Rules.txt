This game adheres to the casino rules for Blackjack. It also has a few
extra rules, since it is a video game. The primary purpose of the game is to
pit your three 'players' against the Casino's dealers and break the bank at
a table in the Casino. Succeeding in doing so or at least having a players
survive enough rounds without breaking their own bank by losing too often
will open up playing against tables with larger banks, and often, with much
better player Blackjack payouts.

There are four types of tables which are also the names player skill levels.
These are:
	STARTER(or beginner): lowest stakes, better blackjack payouts,
	NORMAL: moderate stakes, bigger banks, good blackjack payouts,
	SPECIAL EVENTS: higher stakes, bigger banks, very good blackjack payouts,
	HIGH ROLLER: highest stakes, largest banks, best blackjack payouts.
A player must survive enough rounds in a single game at a particular table
type to 'level up' their skill to the next table type. The number increases
with each higher graduation. A second way to advance is for the player to
be playing at the table when the 'team' of players breaks the dealer's bank.

At the end of any round of play, the user can pull the player from the table.
The best reason is to keep them from losing their bank and being eliminated
from the game. Players who 'leave the table' will be saved when the game ends
just like any other suriving players. The caveat is that they cannot return
to play until the next game.

All players must ante up at the beginning of each round. A dialogue box
will appear for you to enter the player's initial bet (or ante). It must be
sufficient for table minimum, but not exceed the maximum. It also sets the
maximum bet for the hand (see Casino Rules as well).
